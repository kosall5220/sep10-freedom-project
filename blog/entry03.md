### Brainstorming
My SEP10 teacher gave me the task of brainstorming any possible technology that could be used in future of mental health treatment. The first idea I had was an app with resources to help you with your mental struggles with an AI that you can talk to that will give you information about your mental state. I sent this idea on to slack to get feedback from my peers and teacher and I ended up getting some more ideas such as an AI that uses facial expressions to check your mood, and a comfort robot. Here are some details about these possible future inventions:

#### Mental Health App
* An app with resources to help you with your mental struggles, and an AI that you can talk to that will give you information about your mental state.
  * The AI will ask questions such as “how are you feeling” or “why do you feel this way”.
  * The AI will use vocal cues in your voice and your answers to find out what your mental state is .
  * The Ai will also recommend possible routines or activities to support your needs  
  * It will give you advice and tell you encouraging things to cheer you up
  * Since this will be an app, you could easily access it at any time if you have a smartphone or a smartwatch. 
  * This app will help people identify their mental struggles quickly.
  * You could use the app to track your phone use and limit the amount of time you can use an app if you feel like it’s affecting you in a negative way.
  * You will be given access educational information and links to help you understand mental health  
  * If you don’t feel comfortable talking to an AI, the app will also help you find mental health professionals.
    
#### AI face recognition
* Camera with an AI that will recognize your facial expressions and determine your mood.
* This AI could be downloaded as an app on your phone or on anything with a camera.

#### Comfort robot
* A robot that will comfort you by giving you positive advice or by playing calming music
