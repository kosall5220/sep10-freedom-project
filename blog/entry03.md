### Context
After doing research on the mental health field, I have to brainstorm new ideas and prepare the content for my website.

### Brainstorming
The next step I have to take in the Engineering Design Process(EDP) is brainstorming any possible technology that could be used in future of mental health treatment. The first idea I had was an app with resources to help you with your mental struggles with an AI that you can talk to that will give you information about your mental state. I sent this idea on to slack to get feedback from my peers and teacher and I ended up getting some more ideas such as an AI that uses facial expressions to check your mood, and a comfort robot. Here are some details about these possible future inventions:

#### Mental Health App
* An app with resources to help you with your mental struggles, and an AI that you can talk to that will give you information about your mental state.
  * The AI will ask questions such as “how are you feeling” or “why do you feel this way”.
  * The AI will use vocal cues in your voice and your answers to find out what your mental state is .
  * The Ai will also recommend possible routines or activities to support your needs  
  * It will give you advice and tell you encouraging things to cheer you up
  * Since this will be an app, you could easily access it at any time if you have a smartphone or a smartwatch. 
  * This app will help people identify their mental struggles quickly.
  * You could use the app to track your phone use and limit the amount of time you can use an app if you feel like it’s affecting you in a negative way.
  * You will be given access educational information and links to help you understand mental health  
  * If you don’t feel comfortable talking to an AI, the app will also help you find mental health professionals.
    
#### AI face recognition
* Camera with an AI that will recognize your facial expressions and determine your mood.
* This AI could be downloaded as an app on your phone or on anything with a camera.

#### Comfort robot
* A robot that will comfort you by giving you positive advice or by playing calming music

### Finalizing my content
I now have to prepare my content so that it is ready for my website. First I wrote the context to introduce my topic, in my context I mentioned that technology can help with mental health, and I described what the website will be about. Then I added some of the hardware and software that is used in the mental health field. The last thing I added was all of my ideas that I brainstormed. Here is my [content]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K5pMLSKhsHYijfJNWRfZz60BNJ5WPgshAxf-pI6uFyM/edit)

#### Inspirations

### Skills
The skills that I gained from completing part 3 of the Engineering Design Process(brainstorming) is **organization** and **creativity**.

#### Organization
When I had to prepare my content for my website I had to find a way to organize each part of it. Instead of writing my context, ideas, and the mental health technology into one big paragraph, I instead separated each of these into sections. This made it way easier for me to work on each section, and this will make it easier for users to navigate through my website. I also did the same thing for this blog, as you can see, I organized everything into multiple sections and this makes the blog easier to read.

#### Creativity
In this project I had to come up with new technology that will help people with their mental health. So I thought outside the box and came up with new ideas such as an app with an AI that uses vocal cues and facial expressions. This is a great example of how creativity is useful for finding ways to solve problems.

### Summary
I hope to use all of the skills I learned so far to complete the next step in this project which is planing my solutions.
