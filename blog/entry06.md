### Context

Now that I have finished learning [aframe](https://aframe.io/), I now have to complete the next step in the [Engineering Design Process (EDP)](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp), which is creating a prototype.

### Creating the Website layout

Before I started making the website, I made a layout of it by using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc). I created two different layouts, one for mobile and one for desktop.
