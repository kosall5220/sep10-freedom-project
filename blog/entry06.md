### Context

Now that I have finished learning [aframe](https://aframe.io/), I now have to complete the next step in the [Engineering Design Process (EDP)](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp), which is creating a prototype.

### Creating the Website layout

Before I started making the website, I made a layout of it by using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc). I created two different layouts, one for mobile and one for desktop.

* [Mobile layout](https://wireframe.cc/aMMiUN)
* [Desktop layout](https://wireframe.cc/U17GwI)

### Creating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)




### Skills

Some of the skills that I learned while creating my MVP was organization and attention to detail.


#### Organization
While completing the MVP I had to do a lot of organization. For example, when I created my wireframes I added labels to show where my content will be and which components to use.

I also organized my code by adding titles to help me know what part of my website it was for.

```html

<!-- Navigation  -->
<nav> code for navbar </nav>

<!-- Header -->
<header> Code for my heading/title </header>

```

#### Attention to detail
