# Entry 2: Researching devices and hardware related to mental health
##### 11/27/23

## My task
After choosing the topic mental health care to complete my project on, my second task was to research the technology used in the mental health field.

## Devices/hardware used in the mental health field

After researching, I found that there are many devices that are used for treating mental health. Some of the technologies used to treat mental health are **Abilify MyCite**, **Prescription Video Games**, and **Virtual Reality Therapy**. Here are some information about these things:

### Abilify MyCite
**Abilify mycite** is a pill with a sensor inside it, and it’s used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The sensor tracts the time of ingestion, and reports the data to a **wearable patch**. This information can then be accessed by doctors through a smartphone app, and this data helps doctors make treatment plans and decisions based on when the pill is being ingested.

### Prescription Video Games
Video Games can have more of a use than just entertainment. **Prescription video games** are video games used to treat mental health. An example of one of these prescription video games is **EndeavorRX**. EndeavorRX is a game that’s designed for kids ages 8 to 12 with the condition ADHD. This game helps patients with their focus by challenging them to complete multiple tasks.

### Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT)
**Virtual Reality Therapy**, or VRT, is a form of therapy that uses virtual reality to create simulations of real life situations and environments to help people overcome their mental health issues in a realistic way. VRT is used to treat anxiety disorders, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

## Engineering Design process
I am currently in the second stage of the **Engineering Design Process(EDP)**, in this stage I have to research the problem. I decided to do research and take notes on the technology used in mental health care. Some of the websites I found during my research were [Apa.org](https://www.apa.org/members/content/wearable-technology), [Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/11/25/five-tech-innovations-that-changed-mental-health-in-2020/?sh=27e60d831e9c), and [copperdigital.com](https://copperdigital.com/blog/top-5-mental-health-tech-and-innovations-in-2022/). I plan on doing more research to find out any flaws with mental health care so I could move on to the third step of the Engineering Design Process, which is brainstorming possible solutions.

## Skills
Some skills that I learned while completing this blog were **how to google**, and **attention to detail**.

### How to Google
While researching about my topic, I looked up "technology in mental health care" and 923,000,000 results showed up. Since I can’t look through 900 million results, I decided to change my search to "innovations in technology in the mental health field" and I clicked the first website that popped up which was [Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/11/25/five-tech-innovations-that-changed-mental-health-in-2020/?sh=27e60d831e9c). This website had a list of technologies that were new to me, so I did research on the listed devices and I chose to write about the ones that interested me. This made it way easier to find the technology used in mental health care, and how they work.

### Attention to detail
If you want your work to be high quality, you have to pay attention to the details. When I created this blog entry, I wanted to make sure that there were no grammar, and spelling errors in my writing. So I copy and pasted everything into a google doc to see if I made any mistakes, and it fixed all of the small errors that were present in my writing.

## Summary
I’m really excited to take the next step in completing my website about mental health care.
