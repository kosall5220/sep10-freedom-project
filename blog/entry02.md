##### 11/27/23

## Context
After choosing the topic mental health care to complete my project on, my second task is to research the technology used in the mental health care field. Here are all of the notes that I took:

## Devices/hardware used in the mental health field:

After researching I found that there are many devices that are used for treating mental health. Some of the technologies used to treat mental health are **Abilify MyCite**, **Prescription Video Games**, and **Virtual Reality Therapy**.

### Abilify MyCite
Abilify mycite is a pill with a sensor inside it, and itâ€™s used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The sensor tracts the time of ingestion, and reports the data to a wearable patch, and this information can then be accessed by doctors through a smartphone app. The data helps doctors make treatment plans and decisions based on when the pill is being digested.
