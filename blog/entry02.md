# Entry 2: Researching devices and hardware related to mental health
##### 11/27/23

## My task
After choosing the topic mental health care to complete my project on, my second task was to research the technology used in the mental health care field.

## Devices/hardware used in the mental health field

After researching I found that there are many devices that are used for treating mental health. Some of the technologies used to treat mental health are **Abilify MyCite**, **Prescription Video Games**, and **Virtual Reality Therapy**. Here are some information about these things:

### Abilify MyCite
**Abilify mycite** is a pill with a sensor inside it, and it’s used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The sensor tracts the time of ingestion, and reports the data to a **wearable patch**. This information can then be accessed by doctors through a smartphone app, and this data helps doctors make treatment plans and decisions based on when the pill is being digested.

### Prescription Video Games
Video Games can have more of a use than just entertainment. **Prescription video games** are video games used to treat mental health. An example of one of these prescription video games is **EndeavorRX**. EndeavorRX is a game that’s designed for kids ages 8 to 12 with the condition ADHD. This game helps patients with their focus by challenging them to complete multiple tasks.

### Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT)
**Virtual Reality Therapy**, or VRT, is a form of therapy that uses virtual reality to create simulations of real life situations and environments to help people overcome their mental health issues in a realistic way. VRT is used to treat anxiety disorders, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
