# Entry 1: Choosing My Topic (Mental Health Care)
##### 10/23/23

### Why I chose mental health care
The topic that I choose to work on for my project was mental health care since mental health is a topic I am passionate about. I chose to work on mental health care over other topics like education and photography for this project because I was already doing a small amount of research on psychology before I started this project and I'm intrested in finding ways to implement techology when dealing with mental health issues. Some information I found while reseaching were ways to avoid feeling burned out, and how mental health affects education. The resources I used were ["Why Some People Get Burned Out and Others Don't"](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-some-people-get-burned-out-and-others-dont) and ["How mental health affects education"](https://shawmind.org/how-mental-health-affects-education/). One thing that fascinated me were how common it was for people to experience struggles with mental health and knowing how much of a problem mental health was made me more encouraged to expore this topic more.

### Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the first stage of the Engineering Design Process(EDP), in this stage I have to define the problem. With this project, I hope to inform the world about the use of technology in mental health care. Achieving this goal will help people find ways to deal with their own mental struggles and it will also provide more awareness about mental health, which is a topic that many find difficult to understand. The next step in the Engineering Design Process is to research the problem, and I plan to use articles, websites, and videos to do this.

### Skills
Some skills that I learned from working on this blog were **time management**, and **embracing failure**.
