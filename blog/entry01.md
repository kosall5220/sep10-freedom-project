# Entry 1: Choosing My Topic (Mental Health Care)
##### 10/23/23

### Why I chose mental health care
The topic that I choose to work on for my project is mental health care since mental heaLth is a topic I am passionate about. Mental health care was my first choice when picking a topic for this project because I was already doing a small amount of research on psychology before I started this project and I am intrested in finding ways to implement techology when dealing with a mental health problem. Some information I found while reseaching were ways to avoid feeling burned out, and how mental health affects education. The resources I used were ["Why Some People Get Burned Out and Others Don't"](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-some-people-get-burned-out-and-others-dont) and ["How mental health affects education](https://shawmind.org/how-mental-health-affects-education/). Other topics I considered were photography and education but I decided to choose mental health instead.
