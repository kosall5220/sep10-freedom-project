# Entry 1: Choosing My Topic (Mental Health Care)
##### 10/23/23

### Why I chose mental health care
The topic that I choose to work on for my project was mental health care since mental health is a topic I am passionate about. I choose to work on mental health care over other topics like education and photography for this project because I was already doing a small amount of research on psychology before I started this project and I'm intrested in finding ways to implement techology when dealing with mental health issues. Some information I found while reseaching were ways to avoid feeling burned out, and how mental health affects education. The resources I used were ["Why Some People Get Burned Out and Others Don't"](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-some-people-get-burned-out-and-others-dont) and ["How mental health affects education"](https://shawmind.org/how-mental-health-affects-education/). One thing that fascinated me were how common it was for people to experience struggles with mental health and knowing how much of a problem mental health was made me more encouraged to expore this topic more.
