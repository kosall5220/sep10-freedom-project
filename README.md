# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Kosal Lour**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Mental Health Care**.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **mental health treatment** in order to help me make by website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* My website can help people find new ways to treat their mental struggles
* More possible technology to treat mental health
* New businesses for the future technology could be created

##### CONS
* Ideas in my “future technology” section might be expensive to create
* The “comfort robot” could be dangerous if it malfunctions and it might be a safety concern to have a robot move around independently in public.
